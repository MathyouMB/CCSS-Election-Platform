I've previously hosted presentations such as [course selection webinars](https://ccss.carleton.ca/community/news/blog/Course-Selection-Webinar-Slides/) for incoming first years, multiple event about[ finding internships](https://ccss.carleton.ca/community/news/blog/Finding-Internships/) and taking advantage of student resources here at Carleton as well as our annual "Sh*t I wish I Knew" presentation.

If re-elected, I will continue creating and hosting these presentations.
