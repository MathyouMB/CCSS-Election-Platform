I will organize workshops on a variety of industry topics to help students better understand their career path. Some of the topics of presentations I'd like to organize would be:

• Connecting Carleton course material to the workplace 
• Computer Science Research at Carleton 
• Resume Improvement / Critic type events 
• Algorithm Interview preparation 
• System Design Interview preparation

I will also continue to host presentations I’ve previously organized such as [course selection webinars](https://ccss.carleton.ca/community/news/blog/Course-Selection-Webinar-Slides/) for incoming first years and presentations on[ finding internships](https://ccss.carleton.ca/community/news/blog/Finding-Internships/).
