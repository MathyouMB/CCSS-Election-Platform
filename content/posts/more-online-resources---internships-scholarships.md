As part of my website redesign, I will introduce dedicated sections with internship and scholarship postings. I have already been developing [the infrastructure](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/Core) for this initiative this year with Tiffany Lau (Director of Community) and would like to fully complete this project by Fall 2021.
