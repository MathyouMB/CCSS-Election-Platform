As part of my website redesign, I will introduce dedicated sections with internship and scholarship postings.

This year, I created a Django based [dashboard application](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/Core) that allows our CCSS volunteers to easily add and remove student resources from our website.

Next year, I'd like to expand on this initiative and have content such as job postings, internships, volunteer opportunities, and scholarships be at the forefront of our website with an active team to maintain and remove expired links and resources.
