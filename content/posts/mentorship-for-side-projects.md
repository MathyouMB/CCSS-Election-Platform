If elected, I would like to create a mentorship program that allows our members to reach out to dedicated volunteers for help with side projects.

These mentorship positions will also serve as CCR credited positions and 

If it is approved by the school, I would also like to expand this initiative to having dedicated mentors for Carleton CS courses. Many students have previously asked the school of computer science for dedicated tutor options, but it has been difficult to organize due to the workplace legally around recommending tutors over the school's already hired teaching assistants.
