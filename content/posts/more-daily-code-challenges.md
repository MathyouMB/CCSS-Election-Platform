If elected, I will host more events similar to last September’s CCSS Daily Code Challenge.

Last year, I developed the website submission system for the Week of Awesome Daily code challenge and have been working on redeveloping that system to account for some of the issues we faced last year.

I'd like to host another similar event during our Week of Awesome 2021.

I also would like to organize additional "Code Challenge" type of events similar to the [community Advent of Code repository](https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/advent-of-code-2020) I setup last year.
