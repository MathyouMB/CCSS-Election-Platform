As the core maintainer of the [CCSS Website](http://ccss.carleton.ca/), it has come to my attention that our website is not meeting the needs of our society. As we've moved online, we have started many initiatives currently on our website such as a Blog, additional student resources, and even a digital magazine. Due to the existing framework of templates our existing website is built on, it has become difficult and tiresome to modify and create new website content.

If elected, I will build a new modernized website from the ground-up to support our new online resources and initiatives. As the current maintainer of the website, I have already been researching and developing the infrastructure to best suit our society's needs.

I also have a number of ideas for our new website including a Carleton CS news feed and dedicated scholarship and job posting boards.
