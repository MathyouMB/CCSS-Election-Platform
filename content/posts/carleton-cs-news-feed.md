As part of the website redesign,  I will develop a news feed that includes events, initiatives, and projects from all CS related Carleton organizations.

As the society representing all undergraduate computer science students, it's one of our main goals to keep our members aware of the resources available to them. With the recent increase  of CS related groups and clubs here at Carleton, I'd like to create a central place students can see all upcoming events and initiatives from all Carleton CS related organizations.

This will make it significantly less difficult for students to keep track of everything happening in Carleton’s CS community.
