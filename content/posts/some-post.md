If elected, I will continue hosting bi-weekly Dev Club Meetings. Dev Club is a space where students can discuss tech, projects, and more! ![](https://i.giphy.com/media/xbObRI3uKiZgKfjVBG/giphy.webp)

## What Could i be Improved?

As the current organizer of Dev Club, there are a number of improvements I'd like to make to improve Dev Club next year.

### Prepared Discussion Topics

Often the organic conversations started at our meetings are not inclusive to all students due to the siloed nature of technical knowledge. Although I think it's a great resource  for students to listen to those more experienced in a topic, I also understand it can feel ostracising to be on the outside of a conversation and it can feel demeaning to not have a clue what others are talking about.

Having prepared discussion topics would ensure that there is something for everyone to discuss at our meetings and also stop us from inevitably getting off.
