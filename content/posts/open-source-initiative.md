If elected, I would create CCR credited tasks for students on our open source  development projects such as our [website](ccss.carleton.ca) and [Discretemath.ca](http://ccss.carleton.ca/).

As the current maintainer of a lot of our development projects, I think it would be a great idea to open up non-time sensitive development tasks to the Carleton student body.

This would be a great way students who would not like to volunteer on a recurring basis to be involved while getting valuable development experience for their resumes.
