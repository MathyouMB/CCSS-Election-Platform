If elected, I will continue to further develop the COMP 2804 exercise website Discretemath.ca.

DiscreteMath.ca is a web app that lets you virtually take past midterms from COMP 2804. I am the primary software developer on this project and if re-elected, I plan to continue its development with the addition of new resources.

My continued development on this project would:

* Involve creating a brand new and improved user interface
* Lead to the addition of exercises for additional courses
* Lead to the creation of  dynamic resources such as algorithms that  generate new practice questions
