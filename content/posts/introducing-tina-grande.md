If elected, I will continue to further develop the COMP 2804 exercise website [Discretemath.ca]().

During my second year, I worked with previous executives [Alexa De Grandmont](https://github.com/AlexaDeGrandmont), and [Forest Anderson](https://github.com/AngelOnFira) to build [Discretemath.ca](https://discretemath.ca/#/); a web app that lets you virtual take past midterms from COMP 2804. I am the primary software developer on this project and if re-elected, I plan to continue its development with the addition of new resources.
