If elected, I plan to continue the initiatives I've built during my time on the board.\n\n## Thank You\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my platform. I deeply care about the society and hope that you will vote for me in the upcoming election.\n\n![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/gFQQCpr7aXoIzudfdZ/giphy.gif)"
