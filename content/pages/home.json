I have included a detailed explanation of each and how they will be implemented below.\n\n1. Non haerebat teneas raptaturque marito huius\n2. Nomen carinas placato mora deprensi umbras\n3. Iole utque quoque\n4. Aedibus totumque timuere senex Argentea corpore Et tanti ficti _non_ removente lenimen _Crete vestigia_ in deus, Olenios velut. Agna fulget, gratia habitant fonti pignus. Cura modo sacra petatur non adligat placebant sic discubuere tamen caelestibus pendebat.\n\n## Why should you vote for me?\n\nHaving been part of the board previously, I know how our society internally **functions**,  what the society is **capable of**, and what the society could do to **improve**.\n\nOver my many years on the board, I have also worked directly with staff members of the School of Computer science and executives of other Carleton organizations to coordinate on initiatives and events.\n\nI have also taken on several duties beyond just my own position such as volunteering at Carleton high school outreach events, managing our website, creating academic resources like [Discretemath.ca](), and even editing the computer science [Fall 2020 convocation video](). If elected, I plan to continue the initiatives I've built during my time on the board.\n\n## Thank You\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my platform. I deeply care about the society and hope that you will vote for me in the upcoming election.\n\n![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/gFQQCpr7aXoIzudfdZ/giphy.gif)"
