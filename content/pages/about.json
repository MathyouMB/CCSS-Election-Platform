As an incoming forth year student with a variety of industry experience, I know what  supplementary knowledge and academic resources our student body could benefit from.\n\n![Profile](https://i.imgur.com/kvC6kkW.jpg)\n\nOver my many years on the board, I have also worked directly with staff members of the School of Computer science and executives of other Carleton organizations to coordinate on initiatives and events. Having been involved before the pandemic, I can also ensure the CCSS has a safe transition back to in person activity when it is safe to do so.\n\nI have also taken on several duties beyond just my own position such as volunteering at Carleton high school outreach events, managing our website, creating academic resources like [Discretemath.ca](), and even editing the computer science [Fall 2020 convocation video](). If elected, I plan to continue the initiatives I've built during my time on the board.",
